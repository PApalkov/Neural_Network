# Neural_Network
This is the neural network which can understand the handwritten digits.


It uses the MNIST dataset in csv format.

Training set:  http://www.pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv

Test set:  http://www.pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv

## Getting started

After running the gui.py file you'll see the window below:

So, you should write a digit at the center of the panel and the program will 
try to recognize it.
